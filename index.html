          <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Annika Yaworski, a Software Engineering student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.</strong> I’m originally from <strong>Centennial, Colorado</strong>, and I’ve always been passionate about how technology can make everyday life more efficient and connected. 
          </p>When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me outside at the gym, swimming, tanning, or studying in the sunshine. I also love getting involved in my community and finding ways to give back. In high school, I helped organize events to support the homeless, elderly, and new students, and I hope to continue blending my love for technology with service throughout my career.
        </p>
